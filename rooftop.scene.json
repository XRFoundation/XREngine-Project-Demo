Attain the next level of absolute control with the ARENA Viper 8KHz—an ambidextrous esports gaming mouse with a true 8000 Hz polling rate for the fastest speed and lowest latency ever achieved. Upgraded with 2nd-gen ARENA™ Optical Switches, it’s time to rise to the occasion and leave it all on the floor.  OUTPACE THE COMPETITION. BY 8X. INTRODUCING ARENA™ HYPERPOLLING TECHNOLOGY. ARENA™ HyperPolling Technology surpasses the industry standard with a true 8000 Hz polling rate— sending up to 8 times more data in a second and reducing delay from 1 to 1/8th of a millisecond.  Unlike mice with lower polling rates where cursor movement can exhibit inconsistent micro-stutters, ARENA™ HyperPolling Technology ensures ultra-smooth cursor movement—a difference that’s even more apparent on high refresh rate monitors.  ZERO RISK OF MISCLICKS. 2ND-GEN ARENA™ OPTICAL MOUSE SWITCH. Improved with greater tactile feedback, every click now feels and sounds more satisfying. And with no need for a debounce delay used in traditional switches, this lightning-fast actuation is complemented by ARENA™ HyperPolling Technology to provide the lowest input latency that gets you closer to playing like a pro.  FINE-TUNED FOR PIXEL-PERFECT AIM. ARENA™ FOCUS+ OPTICAL SENSOR. With an industry-leading 99.6% resolution accuracy, even the finest movement from this ambidextrous esports gaming mouse is tracked with consistency. Equipped with intelligent functions, the sensor becomes even more accurate, allowing for an acute level of precision for game-winning headshots.  A HEAVY-HITTER THAT WEIGHS ANYTHING BUT. 71G LIGHTWEIGHT DESIGN. Enjoy faster and smoother control with one of the lightest gaming mice in the market. Weighing just 71g, what’s even more impressive is that it achieves its weight without compromising on the build strength of its ambidextrous form factor.  FIRST-CLASS PERFORMANCE. DOWN TO EVERY LAST DETAIL.  ADVANCED ON-BOARD MEMORY Be ready to compete anywhere with up to 5 stored profiles that give you access to optimal keybinds, macros, and twice the inputs via the ARENA HyperShift function.  ARENA™ SPEEDFLEX CABLE Woven for greater flexibility and designed to produce minimal drag, you’ll be able to perform quicker, smoother swipes for tighter mouse control.  INJECTION-MOLDED RUBBER SIDE GRIPS For more secure swipes, the mouse has rubber grips that fully cover its left and right side—molded as part of the shell to ensure they never peel off.  100% PTFE MOUSE FEET This ambidextrous esports gaming mouse is able to glide across any surface thanks to mouse feet made from the purest, highest grade of PTFE.  8 PROGRAMMABLE BUTTONS Fully configurable via ARENA Synapse 3, the 8 programmable buttons let you access macros and secondary functions for an advanced degree of control.  WE’VE GOT YOU COVERED Get up to 2 years of warranty and access reliable tech support. Purchase directly from ARENAStore and get 14 days risk-free returns."
